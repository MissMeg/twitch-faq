## Where are you from?

This should be an easy question to answer :sweat_smile: but I have quite a background when it comes to where I've lived. Currently, I live in the Midwest in the good 'ole U.S of A. I was born in Texas and I have lived in Minnesota, Colorado, Kansas/Missouri, Shanghai, and Orange County.

## What programming languages do you know?

I am currently familiar with the following:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node
* Express
* Python

I am currently working on:

* Vue.JS
* C# for Unity

## Where did you learn to code?

I learned to  code from [Treehouse](teamtreehouse.com). Check it out!

## Do you have any programming guides or tutorials?

Besides the stream, I am also working on creating a patreon to teach coding concepts and provide 1:1 help to new coders and designers.

## Do you have any advice for new coders?

* **DON'T GIVE UP** Learning to code can be difficult and you *will* come across some challenges that will make you want to cry, but push past it! Persevere!
* **Take breaks** When those tough challenges appear you may need to just walk away from the problem for a few minutes or even a few hours. A lot of the time, walking away for a while will not only allow your brain to rest, but you may actually come up with a solution to your problem. I don't know how many times I have gotten stuck on something, walked away, and then a great idea just pops in my head and I go running back to my computer to try it out.
* **Practice, Practice, Practice** Code a bit every day. Even if it is something small, try to do a bit each day. You will be surprised at the progress you make with this simple commitment.
* **Find a Community** Whether it's here in the stream with me or elsewhere, find a group of people you can go to for help, guidance, etc.
* **Measure Your Success Against Yourself** What did you learn today that you couldn't do or didn't know yesterday? Don't worry if you aren't progressing as fast as someone else, they are a completely different person with a different background, skill level, and time to dedicate to learning. Instead measure your success and achievements against your past self.

## I have a question that is not on this FAQ. What do I do?

Create an issue on this repo with your question. You can find the directions [here](https://github.com/MissMeg/twitch-faq/issues/1) and you can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/MissMeg/twitch-faq/issues/new). **Check [current issues](https://github.com/MissMeg/twitch-faq/issues)** first in case your question has already been added.
